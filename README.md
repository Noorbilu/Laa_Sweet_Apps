Laa.I0 Sweet

Laa.I0 Sweet is a fun and simple web app where you can explore different mobile apps and see all their details. You can check app descriptions, ratings, reviews, downloads, and even images. It’s built with React, and all the data comes from a JSON file, so everything updates dynamically. The app also handles cases when an app is not found, showing a friendly error message. This project helped me practice React, React Router, and working with dynamic data, and it shows how to make a clean and easy-to-use app interface.


What Laa.I0 Sweet Does:
-Shows app images, descriptions, downloads, ratings, and reviews dynamically.
-Users can click on an app to see its full details on a separate page.
-Handles errors gracefully when an app is not found.
-Built with React and uses JSON data to display all the information dynamically.
-Designed to be responsive and user-friendly, so it works well on any device.








# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
